## queues_intro_2

This lesson will introduce using multiple queues in concert to accomplish tasks that would be impossible with only a single queue.

**Important**: If you haven't already completed [`queues_intro_1`](../queues_intro_1/README.md), please do that first.

### Concepts

Now that you're familiar with using a queue, you'll notice that, unlike a stack, we _can_ iterate through all the values in a queue without losing them by recycling them to the back of the same queue. This is because the side values are removed from is _different_ than the side values are added to. However, there is still a limitation to this technique: we have no way of knowing when you've reached the end of the queue. As we iterate through each value, the overall size of the queue doesn't change, and eventually we start seeing values we've already seen before. In order to be certain that nothing gets repeated, we need to either throw the extra values away (similar to using a single stack), or use at least one additional data structure to hold values while we go through the original set. One way to handle this is by using a second queue.

As values are `.dequeue()`d out of the first queue, they are `.enqueue()`d into the second queue. Notice how the order of the second queue is the _same_ as the first queue. After the first queue has been completely emptied, then we can return the values to the first queue in the same way.

### The `Queue` class

These exercises use the same `Queue` class as used in [`queues_intro_1`](../queues_intro_1/README.md) (for reference, see its [interface](../../structures/queue/interface.md), [tests](../../structures/queue/index.test.js), and [implementation](../../structures/queue/simplified.js)).

### Before You Begin

Be sure to check out a new branch (from `master`) for this exercise. Detailed instructions can be found [**here**](../../guides/before_each_exercise.md). Then navigate to the `exercises/queues_intro_2` directory in your terminal.

---

### Exercise

Do the following exercises in their respective files. For all of these warm-up exercises, you will use two or more `Queue`s. One is given to you. Other `Queue`s must be instantiated (`new Queue()`). Uncomment the `require()` statement at the top to import the `Queue` class. Do not use any data structures outside of that. Constant-size primitives (`undefined`, `null`, boolean, numbers, single characters (`'g'`), & symbols) are ok. Following each exercise, run the `npm test` command (from within the `exercises/queues_intro_2` directory) to verify it works.

_Note_: Given that these exercises are meant to a) build up familiarity with this data structure, and b) provide practice programming for high performance (the "Algorithms" in "Data Structures & Algorithms"), try to reduce any unnecessary steps the engine must execute, and please do not call any of your custom functions within these definitions.

#### Debugging Notes

While the test output generated by the `npm test` script describes how the exercises _should_ behave and the specific steps they're failing on, it may not tell you _exactly_ what's going on under the hood. To help with that, there are extra tools included to help with debugging:
- If you wish to experiment with either the provided data structures or your exercise solutions, the `npm run repl` script can be run within this directory to enter Node's interactive interpreter. It is the same interface you get when running the `node` command by itself (without specifying a file), except that the data structures and exercise exports are preloaded for you. That means you can jump straight into experimenting with them, without having to manually `require()` them first. However, anything that would cause the exercise scripts to crash (like syntax errors) needs to be fixed first.
- If you wish to see precisely why a test is failing, the `npm run test:debug` script can be run within this directory to enable breakpoints, statement-by-statement execution, and inspecting variables via VS Code's debugging environment (which is very similar to the Source tab on the Chrome inspector).

### Submitting Your Solution

When your solution is complete, return to the root of your `data_structures_lessons` directory. Then commit your changes, push, and submit a Pull Request on GitHub. Detailed instructions can be found [**here**](../../guides/after_each_exercise.md).

### Next Steps

Finished before the next exercise was released? Read over the [`Queue` class implemented on top of a circular vector data structure](../../structures/queue/circular_vector.js), then go back and comment the [Big-O](../../guides/big_o.md) of each function in `queues_intro_1` and `queues_intro_2` while you're waiting. Otherwise, start working on the next exercise while waiting for feedback on your pull request.
